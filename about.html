              <p>As you'll probably have guessed, my name is Cameron Whyte and In July 2020 I graduated from Edinburgh Napier University where I achieved a bachelor of science degree in website design & development.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>So, what attracted me to web development?</h4><br>
              <p>My favourite subject in high school was computing science. One of the things I loved most about it was when we would build small pieces of software using TrueBasic.</p>
              <p>I loved the challenge of being given the instructions for a small piece of software and then chipping away at it until it was fully functioning. Whether it be to create a game of rock, paper, scissors, or to simply create a program that would print your name onto the screen.</p>
              <p>Creating small games and applications using TrueBasic was my first steps in coding and learning how to solve problems. Eventually, we were introduced to the fundamental languages used in creating websites, HTML & CSS. This was what grabbed my attention the most. I loved creating web pages and trying to style them to look like Facebook or Google.</p>
              <p>Putting a few words on a web page, changing the colour of the background and maybe throwing in an image, was my first introduction to web development.</p>
              <p>and you could say it was like a light bulb moment!</p>
              <br>
              <h4>The College Years</h4>
              <br>
              <p>When I left school, I decided to go to Fife College to develop my computing skills, particularly my web development skills. It was during this time I had my first experiences in building responsive websites using a Bootstrap framework.</p>
              <p>It was also at college where I was first introduced to back-end web development. I gained experience in building database-driven websites using MySQL & PHP. I learnt how to set up a database (both written in code and using the phpMyAdmin interface) and build websites that could extract data from the database, add data to a database and how to create a search function to find specific items within the database.</p>
              <p>During these years I was also introduced to Adobe software such as Photoshop, Illustrator & Dreamweaver. Photoshop and Illustrator expanded my knowledge of the role of media within a website and how to prepare and create images that are suitable for the web.</p>
              <p>After college, I was completely sold on web development and decided that my goal was to make this my career.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>The University Years</h4>
              <br>
              <p>After achieving an HND in Web Development at college, I decided to go to Edinburgh Napier University to study for the BSc Website Design and Development degree. During this time I developed my  theoretical understanding of the different aspects involved in the website design and development process.</p>
              <p>I developed an understanding of a user-centred approach to design and development and the processes involved in order to design for a specific target audience and the methods involved in gathering information during the process.</p>
              <p>During my time at university, I learnt about the ways in which a business can apply themselves to the digital environment, and the role that search engine optimisation plays in order to direct traffic towards a particular website.</p>
              <p>I was exposed to the world of cyberpsychology, and how people perceive the digital media they consume, and how you can apply a statistical approach to measure a persons perception of websites and digital content. This particular module gave me my first real experience of data analysis and how you can present data gathered in a number of different ways.</p>
              <p>The final few months of my time at university were particularly challenging due to the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly the group project module which involved being part of a team and building a website for a real client.</p>
              <p>The situation meant that the remainder of the project had to be completed remotely which gave me an insight into some of the platforms and tools available which allow for a team to work from home, the tools and platforms used to complete the project were: Trello, Discord, Skype, OneDrive & BitBucket.</p>
              <p>I played the role of project manager of my group, and together we delivered a project that exceeded our clients expectations and despite the difficult situation, we not only delivered on each item of the project scope, but managed to add in some extra features.

              <br>
              <h4>Post-Graduation</h4>
              <br>
              <p>Since graduating with distinction from Edinburgh Napier University, I've started the process of building up a small portfolio of work which will showcase my skills and further my practical and theoretical understanding of the latest web languages and tools.</p>
              <p>I'm always looking to add new web languages and tools to my skillset via online platforms, such as Codecademy, Stack Overflow & Github.</p>
              <p>I'm currently seeking opportunities to learn from experienced developers in order to develop upon my own skills and experience and to also further my understanding on the ideas, processes and methods used in order to develop high-quality IT solutions.</p>
